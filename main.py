"""Convert IP address to binary:
The IP address is split into four octets using the dot (.) as a delimiter.
For each octet, the "int" function is used to convert it into an integer.
The "bin" function is then used to convert the integer into a binary string.
The "[2:]" notation is used to remove the '0b' prefix that is added to the binary string by the "bin" function.
The "zfill" function is used to pad the binary string with zeros so that it is 8 characters long.
The resulting binary string for each octet is concatenated into a single string.
The final binary string representing the IP address is returned by the function.
